# UdaciFeeds

An single page web app which loads the most recent posts from four weblogs:
Udacity, CSS Tricks, HTML5 Rocks, and Linear Digressions. Also included is a
Jasmine test suite which assures you, dear user, that the webapp works before
you even need lift a finger to find out yourself.

## How to use

Clone the repository and open index.html. Scroll to the bottom the page to
assure yourself the app works, then dive in! Click on a post to open it on its
original domain. To switch the feed, open the hamburger menu and select a new
feed. Wait a second--no need to worry, as Jasmine assures you the feed will
load--and scroll through a whole new page of content!
